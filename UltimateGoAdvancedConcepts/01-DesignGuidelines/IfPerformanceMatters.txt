If Performance Matters

4 tops reasons as to why your software isn't running as fast as it should be:
 1. External latencies
   - system calls
   - waiting on things on the network
   - milliseconds of time
   - microservices occur milliseconds of latency
 2. Internal latency costs
   - garbage collector
   - synchronization and orchestration
 3. Access data on the machine
   - access and store affects how performant we are
 4. Algorithmic efficiency
   - not going to hurt us unless we are in tight loops
   - readability over algorithmic efficiency if it doesn't kill our code
