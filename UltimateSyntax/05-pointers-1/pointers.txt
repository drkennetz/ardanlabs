// value semantics says that a piece of code is copied as it moves around your program
// every piece of program that operates on data uses its own copy of the data

// pointer semantics says we're not copying data as we move it across our program
// there's one copy, and it will be shared by everybody

// when we're working with value semantics, we can actually achieve higher levels of integrity in our software
// mutation of memory causes high level of bugs in programs

// when everybody works on own copy, it's easier to copy
// extra complexity in code is cost of value semantics

// when to use values over pointers? will learn later
