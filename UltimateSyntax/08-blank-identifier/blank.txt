the blank identifier "_" is used when you don't want to capture a return. For example:

val, _ := strconv.Atoi("10")

this package returns a value and an error.
- val will be "10" converted to an int32 -> 10
- _ would be the error, but I have thrown it away.
- generally we want to check errors, but this is just an example.
- if we assign this to a variable in our program and don't check it, the compiler will complain that a value has been assigned to a variable that isn't being used.
